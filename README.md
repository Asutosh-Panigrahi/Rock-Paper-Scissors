# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is an interactive game that uses computer vision to recognize hand gestures and allows users to play against an AI opponent. Developed using Python and OpenCV, the game captures hand gestures via a webcam, interprets them, and determines the winner based on the classic rules of Rock Paper Scissors.
